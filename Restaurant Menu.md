Python / Restaurant Menu

This is one of my first Python projects i created.
It is a simple restaurant menu with few functions which alloes users to choose a main dish, select three topping if available and pick a drink from the menu. 
The program uses loops and input validation to guide through the user orders.
The main goal is to provide a practical example of Python functions and user interaction.
